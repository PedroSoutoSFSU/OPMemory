## UI Mock-up
- Coming soon

## Description
- Our 2D web game will be a memory based card game. The cards will be laid faced down in a 5x5 grid, and players will take turns finding pairs. In order to find a pair, a player must first pick one card. That card will flip over and be revealed. The player must then attempt to pick the other matching card. If a player picks a matching pair, they go again. Once a player fails to pick a matching pair, their turn is over, and the other player's turn begins.

## Extra features planned (If Time)
- Each player starts the game with 3 "action" cards. These cards will have various effects (such as: suffle the board, reveal 2 cards, etc). At the begginning of a player's turn, they may choose to play an action card. This card's action will take place, then the player will resume their turn normally.
